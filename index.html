		<span>This slider controls the bias value. the bias value controls how favorable are paths that are closer to the end, rather than farther from the start. <br>
			  The higher the bias is, the less the algorithm will look at the wrong direction, but it does mess with the algorithm's perception of diagonals, <br>
			  and sometimes with low bias values, the algorithm will wrong diagonal paths, but it will get to the answer faster.<br>
